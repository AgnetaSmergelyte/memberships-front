# Project Overview

## Front-End:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Seamless navigation and dynamic page rendering made using React-Router.

Efficient data flow across components and consistent state management implemented by Redux.

Web Design enhanced with SCSS.

## Back-End:

Server has been powered by Node.js, a runtime environment known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for scalable applications.

Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, was used to build the server's API endpoints and handle middleware.

Data storage and management is handled using MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.
